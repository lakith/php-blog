ZERO ZERO LIVE BLOGGER READ ME FILE.

This is a text blog suite that contains most of the functions that should be in a text blog. You can view all the posts but If you want to add posts you must create a account on this blog.

Implantation note.
Before implementation you have to install XAMPP on your PC. Then from its control panel start apache server and MySQL database. Then import the database  “blog” from the database folder to the phpmyadmin. Database will import without any errors.(I tested it.SQL file will create the database as well as all the tables, and all the data will be dumped into tables automatically)Then copy all the content to htdocs folder then run it from the browser.
